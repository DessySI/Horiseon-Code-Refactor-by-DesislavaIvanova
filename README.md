# Horiseon-Code-Refactor-by-DesislavaIvanova

## Description

The main focus of "Code Refactor" project was accessibility improvement, light boost on the performance, provided with clear comments after every change in both HTML and CSS files, due to possibile upcoming changes. On this stage I have implemented "meta name='keywords'" and "meta name='viewport'" in order to boost the accessibility, fully semantic structured HTML file, reordered and combined CSS selectors, which improves the performance. I've also fixed the navigation link for "Search Engine Optimization" and it now leads to the corresponding article on the app.
